# Guides, tutorials and code culture compedium by 2N

This document will serve as the compendium for our company's standards.

Just like in code, documentations need some rules and practices to help readability:
1. Multiple files divised by subjects instead of a single giant one
2. Maintain some categorisation system and hierarchy to help browsing
3. make use of folders
